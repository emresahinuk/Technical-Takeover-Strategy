# Technical Takeover Strategy as CTO  

## Critical Problems & Solutions  

### 1. Problem: Knowledge Silos and Tribal Expertise  
**Spiky POV:**  
*Legacy expertise must be extracted systematically, not passively, using AI to codify tacit knowledge into actionable, searchable formats.*  

**Approach:**  
- **Daily Knowledge Sprints:** 60-minute interviews with legacy experts (recorded/transcribed via AI tools like Otter.ai).  
- **AI-Driven Codification:** Use GPT-4 to auto-summarize sessions, tag insights by system/module, and link to code repositories.  
- **Structured Wiki:** Build a Notion/wiki knowledge base with cross-linked entries (e.g., “Deployment Pipeline” → linked to repo X, troubleshooting guide Y).  

**Success Metrics:**  
- 100% of critical workflows documented and searchable within 2 minutes.  
- Zero “black box” modules unaccounted for after 30 days.
