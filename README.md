Second Brain: Technical Takeover Strategy as CTO
Critical Problems & Solutions

1. Problem: Knowledge Silos and Tribal Expertise
Spiky POV:
Legacy expertise must be extracted systematically, not passively, using AI to codify tacit knowledge into actionable, searchable formats.
Approach:

Daily Knowledge Sprints: 60-minute interviews with legacy experts (recorded/transcribed via AI tools like Otter.ai).

AI-Driven Codification: Use GPT-4 to auto-summarize sessions, tag insights by system/module, and link to code repositories.

Structured Wiki: Build a Notion/wiki knowledge base with cross-linked entries (e.g., “Deployment Pipeline” → linked to repo X, troubleshooting guide Y).
Success Metrics:

100% of critical workflows (deployment, billing logic) documented and searchable within 2 minutes.

Zero “black box” modules unaccounted for after 30 days.

2. Problem: Architectural Complexity and Technical Debt
Spiky POV:
Technical debt is a feature, not a bug—map it ruthlessly, prioritize fixes by business impact, and use AI to predict hidden risks.
Approach:

AI-Powered Audits: Run CodeQL/SonarQube + GPT-4 to flag high-risk areas (e.g., untested code, circular dependencies).

Visual Debt Mapping: Use Miro/D3.js to create dependency graphs annotated with expert context (e.g., “Module A’s API is fragile due to a 2018 hack”).

Risk-Driven Prioritization: Fix debt with the highest predicted failure likelihood first (e.g., “Refactor Module B: 85% outage risk if untouched”).
Success Metrics:

Top 3 debt hotspots resolved in 60 days.

Zero unplanned outages from legacy code in 90 days.

3. Problem: Integration with Acquiring Company’s Systems
Spiky POV:
Integration is a cultural and technical challenge. To avoid disruption, use phased rollouts, AI simulations, and “guardrail” metrics.
Approach:

AI-Driven Gap Analysis: Audit APIs/data models using Postman + GPT-4 for schema mismatches.

Phased Rollouts: Deploy via feature flags, monitored by AI observability tools (Datadog + Lightrun).

Simulation Testing: Use GitHub Copilot to auto-generate load/stress test scenarios.
Success Metrics:

2 core modules integrated seamlessly in 30 days.

Zero critical outages; 20% performance gain post-migration.

Document Specs:

Length: 1.5 pages (succinct, no fluff).

AI Tools Used: GPT-4 for summarization, CodeQL for code analysis, and Copilot for testing.

Sharing Settings: Publicly viewable (hypothetical link).
